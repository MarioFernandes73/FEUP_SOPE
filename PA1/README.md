# Practical Assignment 1

In this assignment the students had to develop a program which detected and managed the existence of duplicated regular files, within a directory (which could have multiple sub-directories).

The program itself had to detect the duplicated files and maitain the oldest entry; the rest of them needed to be converted into hard links to that entry.

During this project the capability of file and directory manipulation, the development of multiprocess application and the invocation of external programs was learned and familiarized.
